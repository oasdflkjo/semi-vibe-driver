# Changes to Semi-Vibe-Device Simulator

## Simplification Changes

1. **Removed Linux Support**
   - Modified all code to focus exclusively on Windows
   - Removed platform-specific checks and Linux-related code paths
   - Simplified DLL loading logic in Python scripts

2. **Threading Implementation**
   - Initially removed multithreading and mutex code for simplification
   - Later reintroduced a single server thread to handle client connections without blocking
   - The main thread now returns immediately after starting the server

3. **Server Implementation**
   - Updated `server.py` to handle the non-blocking server implementation
   - Added a loop with KeyboardInterrupt handling to keep the server running
   - Improved server shutdown logic

4. **Run Script**
   - Updated `run.py` to work with the new threading model
   - Added server readiness check when running both server and client
   - Improved user feedback about server status

## Current Implementation

The current implementation:

1. Uses a single thread for handling client connections
2. Runs exclusively on Windows
3. Follows the device specification in LAW.md
4. Provides simple build and run scripts for easy usage
5. Maintains all functionality of the original device simulator

## Usage Notes

- When running `python run.py both`, the server starts in a separate window that must be closed manually
- The server can be stopped with Ctrl+C when run directly with `python python/server.py`
- All commands and functionality defined in LAW.md are fully supported
